### Tips:The teacher gives questions in almost every class, and these questions often appear in the midterms and finals. She also points out the answers, emphasizing what to write, but as she speaks very fast, those who can’t keep up should consider voice recording for better understanding. Additionally, the teacher conducts quizzes on articles. Although articles don’t appear in exams, these quizzes are important. She mentions the articles quickly in class, so it’s essential to note down or remember which ones she refers to.
## There was 3 quizzes: 1 was on article, another 2 on the questions she gave and 2 assignments. Quiz: All counts, Assignment: best 1.
## Assignment 2: Gender stratification
You have read about basic concepts like sex, gender, sexuality, recurrent gender patterns, gender stratification/ inequality and violence. You must watch the following videos, choose any video (you can combine them too) and reflect. Analyse them using the concepts you have learned so far. The questions you should keep in mind while reflecting on them are:
What kind of gender roles are portrayed in the video?
Do they conform to certain gender stereotypes?
Does it show any recurring gender stereotypes you are familiar with?
What kind of gender stratification leads to discrimination shown in these videos?
What are the structural changes required to fight these discriminations?
How do you see yourself mitigating these gender gaps?
