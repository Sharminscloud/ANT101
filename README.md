# Feculty: SES
##Tips:The teacher gives questions in almost every class, and these questions often appear in the midterms and finals. She also points out the answers, emphasizing what to write, but as she speaks very fast, those who can’t keep up should consider voice recording for better understanding. Additionally, the teacher conducts quizzes on articles. Although articles don’t appear in exams, these quizzes are important. She mentions the articles quickly in class, so it’s essential to note down or remember which ones she refers to.
## There was 3 quizzes: 1 was on article, another 2 on the questions she gave and 2 assignments. Quiz: All counts, Assignment: best 1.
